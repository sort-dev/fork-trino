# Trino DuckLake Connector — Feature Support

Connector for the [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select) open table format (spec v1.0).
Uses PostgreSQL as the catalog metadata backend.

Tested with DuckDB 1.5.2 for cross-engine compatibility.

## Partitioning

| Transform | Read | Write | Notes |
|-----------|:----:|:-----:|-------|
| Identity | Yes | Yes | Partition by column value |
| `year(col)` | Yes | Yes | Date or timestamp column |
| `month(col)` | Yes | Yes | Date or timestamp column |
| `day(col)` | Yes | Yes | Date or timestamp column |

| `bucket(N, col)` | No | No | Planned — Murmur3 hash partitioning |

Temporal partition encoding supports both calendar (DuckDB default) and epoch (spec-defined)
modes, configurable via `ducklake.temporal-partition-encoding`. The read path is lenient by
default and handles both encodings transparently.

## Statistics

| Statistic | Supported | Notes |
|-----------|:---------:|-------|
| Table row count | Yes | From `ducklake_table_stats` |
| Column min/max (table-level) | Yes | Typed parsing of string-encoded values |
| Column min/max (file-level, for pruning) | Yes | From `ducklake_file_column_stats` |
| Column null count (file-level) | Yes | Used in file pruning decisions |
| Conservative mode for deletes | Yes | Returns unknown stats when delete files are present |
| Conservative mode for mixed inline+Parquet | Yes | Row count preserved, column stats suppressed |
| Conservative mode for schema evolution | Yes | Stats suppressed when coverage is incomplete |

## Cross-Engine Compatibility

The connector is tested for bidirectional compatibility with DuckDB:

| Direction | Tested | Notes |
|-----------|:------:|-------|
| DuckDB writes, Trino reads | Yes | Full column value round-trips validated |
| Trino writes, DuckDB reads | Yes | Parquet field_id mapping ensures correct column matching |
| Shared PostgreSQL catalog | Yes | Both engines operate on the same metadata |
| Inlined data created by DuckDB | Yes | Trino reads inlined rows from catalog tables |
| Schema evolution across engines | Yes | ADD COLUMN by one engine, read by the other |

## Configuration

| Property | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|:--------:|---------|-------------|
| `ducklake.catalog.database-url` | Yes | — | JDBC URL for PostgreSQL catalog |
| `ducklake.catalog.database-user` | Yes | — | Catalog database username |
| `ducklake.catalog.database-password` | Yes | — | Catalog database password |
| `ducklake.data-path` | Yes | — | Base path for data files |
| `ducklake.catalog.max-connections` | No | 10 | Max JDBC connections to catalog |
| `ducklake.default-snapshot-id` | No | — | Pin all reads to a snapshot ID |
| `ducklake.default-snapshot-timestamp` | No | — | Pin all reads to a point in time |
| `ducklake.temporal-partition-encoding` | No | `calendar` | `calendar` or `epoch` |
| `ducklake.temporal-partition-encoding-read-leniency` | No | `true` | Accept both encodings on read |

Session properties: `read_snapshot_id`, `read_snapshot_timestamp`

Snapshot resolution precedence: query clause > session property > catalog config > current snapshot.

## Not Yet Implemented

### Maintenance Operations

Not available through Trino. Use DuckDB's ducklake extension against the shared PostgreSQL
catalog for these operations. Planned for a future milestone:

- `ALTER TABLE ... EXECUTE optimize` (merge adjacent files)
- `ALTER TABLE ... EXECUTE rewrite_data_files`
- `expire_snapshots` (connector procedure)
- `cleanup_old_files` (connector procedure)
- `remove_orphan_files` (connector procedure)
- `flush_inlined_data` (connector procedure)
- `recalc stats` (rescan data files and recompute table/column stats)

### DDL

- `RENAME TABLE`
- `RENAME SCHEMA`
- `COMMENT ON TABLE`
- `COMMENT ON COLUMN` (table columns; view column comments are supported)
- `ALTER TABLE SET TYPE` (type promotion)
- `ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP FIELD` (nested struct field manipulation)

### Commit Context

Planned session properties for annotating write snapshots (DuckDB `set_commit_message`
equivalent):

- `commit_author`
- `commit_message`
- `commit_extra_info`

### Change Feed

DuckDB equivalents not yet exposed through Trino:

- `table_changes(table, start_snapshot, end_snapshot)`
- `table_insertions(table, start_snapshot, end_snapshot)`
- `table_deletions(table, start_snapshot, end_snapshot)`

### Cross-Dialect View Transpilation

Views created by DuckDB (or other engines) are not visible in Trino. Only Trino-dialect
views are exposed. Cross-dialect transpilation (e.g., DuckDB SQL to Trino SQL) is a
research item.

### Catalog Backends

Only the PostgreSQL catalog backend is supported. SQLite and DuckDB catalog backends are
planned for future single-user/local-dev workflows.

## Known Limitations

- The `variant` type is readable as VARCHAR but without shredded field access
  (e.g., `payload.user` syntax is not supported). Variant statistics for shredded
  sub-fields are not used for pushdown.
- Geometry types are readable as VARBINARY but without spatial functions or bounding-box
  statistics for file pruning.
- `int128` and `uint128` types are not yet mapped. Tables containing these columns will
  report a type conversion error. These types are rare in practice and do not have min/max
  statistics in the DuckLake spec.
- The DuckLake spec's `linestring_z` type (renamed from `linestring z` in spec v1.0) is not
  yet recognized by the type converter.
- Unsigned integer types (uint8/16/32/64) are widened to larger signed Trino types on read.
  No range validation is performed on the write path — writing a value that exceeds the
  unsigned range of the DuckLake column type is not prevented.
- Files written before a failed commit become orphans. DuckLake's
  `ducklake_delete_orphaned_files()` maintenance procedure handles cleanup.
- Puffin deletion vectors (experimental in DuckLake 1.0, opt-in) are not supported. Tables
  using `write_deletion_vectors=true` will not be readable through this connector.
